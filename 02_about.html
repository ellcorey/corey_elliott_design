	<h1 class="page-heading">About Me</h1>
	
		<section class="content-block">

		<p>Originally from Corpus Christi, TX, I've been living in Austin for more than 25 years. I have a strong passion for all aspects of design. Ultimately my appreciation of industrial design led me on the path to digital interface design &emdash the principles are similar and good interactions and solutions can be found in the phsyical objects we interact with every day.

		<p>I value simplicity and minimalism in moderation for personal design. I grew up with a love of Ian Anderson's Designer's Republic, and subsequently have fallen for high-end studios like Build. Later on, an interest for the physical led me to Dieter Rams, the Eames, and Hartmut Esslinger. 

		<p>Design plays a part in almost all of my hobbies &emdash when I'm not working on a project, I enjoy a laudry list of them. Cycling, motorcycles (& racing them), football(soccer), snowboarding, and photography just to name a few.

		<p>Outside of work and hobbies, I enjoy a casual life in one of Austin's calmest neighborhoods with my my wife Helen, daugther Barrett, and two dogs.</p>
