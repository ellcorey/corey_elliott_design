		<h1 class="page-heading">About Me</h1>

		<p>Originally from Corpus Christi, TX, I've been living in Austin for more than 25 years. I have a strong passion for all aspects of design. Ultimately my appreciation of industrial design led me on the path to digital interface design &emdash the principles are similar and good interactions and solutions can be found in the phsyical objects we interact with every day.

		<p>I value simplicity and minimalism in design, but also have a wild side. In my teens, I discovered The Designer's Republic. The juxtoposition of coporatist themes with provocative layouts, logos, and post-modern leanings, was intoxicating to me. The heavy use of sans-serif and bold colors has stuck with me.

		<p>Design plays a part in almost all of my hobbies &emdash when I'm not working on a project, I enjoy a laudry list of them. Cycling, motorcycles (& racing them), football(soccer), snowboarding, and photography just to name a few.

		<p>Outside of work and hobbies, I enjoy a laid-back life in one of Austin's calmest neighborhoods with my wife Helen, daugther Barrett, and two dogs.</p>
