	      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
	      <p>The Kindness Project is a prototype app built in Invision and involved collaboration and client interaction. Working with another designer, we had to rapidly produce a prototype that would meet our client's needs over the course of 5 days.</p>
	      
	      <p>The process involved a hefty amount of research prior to the design process. Requirements were to have a prototype showing main app screens and functions, and a responsive single page site that would act as an overview on the web.</p>
	      
	      <p>The project is hosted through a combination of Github and Invision and can be easily viewed.</p>

	      <h2>Concept Overview</h2>
	      <p>The concept of Zephyr is an app that will take existing map data (topography, road ways, bike lanes, traffic), combine it with user-sourced data (anonymous tracking, issue reports), and use that information to provide bicycle commuters with a safe route that attempts to negate geographical.</p>

	      <p>With this app, we could increase bicycle commuting in Austin. There are many advantages to having a larger bicycling population, but one of the largest is that overall the city becomes happier and safer.</p>
