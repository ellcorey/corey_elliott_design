# Zephyr
## A conceptual app for bicycle routing

### Project overview
This project took place over a two week period at the end of my course with The Iron Yard. The project encompassed much of what we'd learned (and some we didn't).

The process involved a hefty amount of research prior to the design process. Requirements were to have a prototype showing main app screens and functions, and a responsive single page site that would act as an overview on the web.

The project is hosted through a combination of Github and Pixate and can be easily viewed.

### Conceptual overview
The concept of Zephyr is an app that will take existing map data (topography, road ways, bike lanes, traffic), combine it with user-sourced data (anonymous tracking, issue reports), and use that information to provide bicycle commuters with a safe route that attempts to negate geographical.

With this app, we could increase bicycle commuting in Austin. There are many advantages to having a larger bicycling population, but one of the largest is that overall the city becomes happier and safer.

### Research & Discovery
Even though I had an idea, I needed verify my hypothetical solution with research. Research also provides direction in design and is required when taking on a project (it can also be pretty neat and insightful).

#### Questioning & surveying
Research began with a survey I created using [Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/ "Google Forms") (the actual form can be seen [here](http://goo.gl/forms/iIKEmh38Yj/ "bicycle commuting form")). I sent this form out via a variety of channels and waited for incoming response frequency to slow before analyzing the data. Responses varied, but unsurprisingly fell within several key areas of focus. Traffic, routing, and weather were predominant issues.

I solicited friends who are active in the cycling community in addition to the survey. The responses were generally in line with each other and pointed out Austin's bike infrastructure is better perceived than it actually is.

>"The bike lanes are worse than a joke--they're on major roads and they'll just disappear for a block or two..."

#### General research
Throughout the project, I used resources like [Bike Austin](www.bikeaustin.org/ "Bike Austin"), [The League of American Bicyclists](http://www.bikeleague.org/ "League of American Bicyclists"), and [Copenhagenize](http://copenhagenize.eu/ "Copenhagenize") to back up the data I'd collected myself. I also made notes of information that may not directly pertain to my problem, but could assist in the direction.

#### Competitive market analysis
A competitive market analysis was created to see if a similar product already existed and what competing products may offer. The cycling app market is cluttered with apps targeted at recreational cyclists --- they do not help the commuting cyclist. 

[Ride the City](http://www.ridethecity.com/ "Ride the City") is one app that offers "safer routes" as a solution. Users cite a cumbersome, unattractive UI, and poor routes specifically in Austin as issues. I had difficulty locating information on how routes are built --- the lack of transparency potentially leading to pain points while en route. A large opportunity to add community aspects also exists.

#### Inspirational apps
I looked to a few apps for well designed and thought out UI. Strava and Waze are two that provided inspiration. Strava for a clean and modern UI high on contrast with plenty of gamification, and Waze for clever hands-free actions. Waze is also known well for users reports --- reported issues that can serve as temporary alerts, or even help to re-route other users.

#### Personas
I used personas to help distill down my possible user base and aid in design decisions, and were created using my research. The personas primarily indicate people who are already willing to use a bike as transportation.

#### Joanna
- Neighborhood: Mueller
- Commute: 5 miles
- Title: software developer
- Age: 33
Joanna is renting in Mueller and working downtown in the Tech industry. Moved to Austin from Raleigh, NC a little over a year ago. After renting in South Austin, she moved to Mueller to live more centrally and stop relying on her car as much. Determined but a bit of a procrastinator.

    + loves finding new restaurants
    + often attends live music shows
    + plays recreational adult team sports (kickball, whiffle ball, etc.)
    + prefers movie experience at Alamo Drafthouse
    + travels with Southwest Airlines
    + comfortable with hand tools

#### Michael
- Neighborhood: Duval Estates
- Commute: 16 miles
- Title: education admin
- Age: 40
Longtime Austin resident, Michael, hates driving, especially in traffic. Environmentally conscious, active in local community non-profits. Family of 4 with 2 children, living in North Austin for over a decade. Commutes across town to South Austin and primarily uses mass transit. Cycles on weekends without prior engagements.

    + donates time to educational assistance for children
    + has a woodworking shop set up in his garage
    + spends time gardening home grown vegetables
    + adopted a pit bull with his kids
    + owns a 7 year old Subaru wagon
    + enjoys an evening downtown with his wife every other month

#### Dale
- Neighborhood: Zilker
- Commute: 4 miles
- Title: server
- Age: 28
Dale rents a small place in Zilker from a friend. He works as a server at a couple different locations on the East side, and relies solely on a bicycle for transportation.

    + doesn't spend much time at home
    + has had poor experiences with public transportation
    + plays in a honky tonk band and is heavy into the local music community
    + tries to be outside in his free time
    + donates a little time when he can to work with Austin Pets Alive
    + enjoys a stiff, cheap drink daily

### Let's get to B
The concept of Zephyr is an app that will take existing map data (topography, road ways, bike lanes, traffic), combine it with user-sourced data (anonymous tracking, issue reports)

In a perfect world, research starts before a project, and continues right up until it's unsupported. The Iron Yard is not a perfect world, and with research set, design began.
