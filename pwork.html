    	<h2>AF1 Racing</h2>
    	<p>AF1 Racing is a local Austin motorcycle dealer with a world-wide presence. I handled the design work and social interaction for our local customers. At the time, we had 2 locations &mdash; Austin and New Braunfels. The Austin location acted as the primary dealership while New Braunfels handled the large international mail order buisiness. As the designer in Austin, I worked to improve our overall branding and web presence.</p>
