    	<h2>AF1 Racing</h2>
    	<p>AF1 Racing is a local Austin motorcycle dealer with an international presence. I handled the design work and social interaction for our local Austin customers. At the time, we had 2 locations &mdash; Austin and New Braunfels. The Austin location acted as the primary dealership while New Braunfels handled the large international mail order buisiness. As the designer in Austin, I worked to improve our overall branding and web presence.</p>

    	<h3>Branding</h3>
    	<p>When I started at AF1 in the summer of 2013, There was a glaring need to redesign a number of business related items. Upon returnting to Austin, the company had added two key brands in Vespa and Moto Guzzi that would serve as the foundation for much of our business. A challenge was to adjust our approach in Austin from being sport oriented to be more inline with these two classic Italian marques.</p>

    	<p>I designed a new logo largely inspired by the number plates on classic racing motorcycles. The new logo also channeled the classic roundels often found on Vespa leg shields. The round shape allowed it to adapt easier to use on the web, print, and social media &mdash; an issue I ran into with the sportier logo.</p>

    	<p>Our business cards were in real need of a refresh as well. Content was definitely a challenge at the time. Both locations, both websites, and a long list of brands carried were requirements put in place by the owners.</p>
