    	<h2>AF1 Racing</h2>
    	<p>AF1 Racing is a local Austin motorcycle dealer with an international presence. As the Graphic Designer, I handled the design, branding, and social media interaction for Austin our Austin location.</p>

    	<p>I created a new logo inspired by classic racing number plates to better match our Austin customer base. The new logo needed to be easier to place for social media, images, and advertisements.</p>

    	<p>Redesigning the AF1 Racing Austin website was a priority for me upon starting. I wanted the site to echo AF1's standing as one of the top dealers in the country &mdash; showing the strengths, character and lifestyle of the brand.</p>

    	<p>Along with the site redesign, I switched our e-blast client to <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> and created templates for both local and online customer mailers.</p>

    	<p>During my time with AF1, I got the chance to design the website and related media for a scooter rally we sponsored called the Dirty Rally. The rally project was enjoyable and a step away from the normal motorcycle shop work. I also enjoyed all the love from the rally-goers.</p>
