	      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
	      <p>Goodreads is a great website for readers. It offers an enourmous amount of book related content and features. That strength is also it's weakness. The amount of content is massive and crammed into a dusty, dated design.</p>

	      <p>I was tasked with creating a redesign of one of the major pages of the Goodreads site. The goals were better content management and a less claustrophobic design.</p>

	      <a name="concept"><h2>Concept Overview</h2></a>
	      <p>Our client wanted to develop an application that can help spread the philosophy of daily acts of kindness by encouraging or challenging others. The design needed to meet certain criteria being simple, friendly, positive, and encouraging.</p>

	    	<h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
			<p>To tackle this project quickly, we chose to use a couple of quick, effective research methods. During the research phase, we discussed our ideas and direction with the client. Part of this involved chatting about philosophy of acts of kindness &mdash; had we not had discussed this, the app would have a different focus.</p>

			<h3>content list and management</h3>

			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>For this project, the majority of research was completed by Emily while I began rough sketching ideas and speaking with our client. The SWOT analysis, personas, and wordlist can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ellcorey/kindness_app/tree/master/research_ed">Github</a>.

	    	<h2>Design</h2>
	    	<p>For the design portion of this project, I worked out some early user flows before sketching some basic layout ideas. This all started earlier in the project than normal, and I knew that meant a higher chance of changes, and those changes could be more difficult. Given our short time line, I understood the risk &mdash; being flexible was key.</p>

	    	<h3>Style Tiles</h3>
	    	<p>Style tiles were created for this project to show our client variations of color, typographic choices, and share an overall feel. The argument for using style tiles is they give a better idea of the project direction than a mood board, and aren't as time consuming as mock-ups. for this project were split up amongst both designers. 5 tiles in total were submitted to our client for feedback, and ultimately one was selected and tweaked.</p>

	    		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/goodreads/gr_styles02.jpg" alt="unused style tile">
	    	</div>

	    	<h3>Low-fidelity sketches</h3>
	    	<p>Screen sketches were created using the research we had done and user flows. Once I had confirmed a sketch, I could hand it off to Emily to wireframe.</p>

	    		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/goodreads/sktch_dash02.jpg">
	    	</div>

	    	<h3>High-fidelity mock-ups</h3>
	    	<p>The mock-ups for all screens were created in Adobe Illustrator. After completing a sequence of wireframes, Emily would hand them off to me to create the mock-ups. Emily created a few of the mock-up screens as well, and afterwards, I would check them for continuity with my mock-ups.

	    	<h3>Invision prototyping</h3>
	    	<p>This was my first experience with prototyping an app in Invision. I took our mockup screens, imported them into Invision, and mapped out the flows between screens. Unlike applications such as Pixate, Framer, and Flinto, Invision currently only offers a few pre-set interactions. Choosing the correct prototyping tool for your project is very important.</p>

	    	<p>For our client, interactions were more important to broadly show flow through the app. Invision was perfect. Had we needed to prototype a complex interaction that would help provide context and reduce cognitive load, we would have looked to something else.
