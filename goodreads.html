	      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
	      <p>Goodreads is a great website for readers. It offers an enourmous amount of book related content and features. That strength is also it's weakness. The amount of content is massive and crammed into a dusty, dated design.</p>

	      <p>I wanted to redesign the Goodreads main user page with better content management, a more modern design, and a less claustrophobic feel. It was important to not alienate existing users by removing key features.</p>

	      <a name="concept"><h2>Concept Overview</h2></a>
	      <p>The current website tries to offer up a lot of features all at once. As a Goodreads user, I knew that book tracking as well as recommendations were probably the most important features to a majority of users. I wanted to make these front and center and manage the clutter.</p>

	      <p>Goodreads' design is also very bookish. It feels like a dusty old library. That could be a good thing for a particular user, but I felt there was an opportunity to let some light in with the organization. </p>

	   		<h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
			<p>For this project, I kept the research pretty light. I wanted to speak directly with current users and see what primary and secondary features they use most. During this phase, I quizzed friends, family, and peers that shared our work space. In addition to the features I inquired about, I asked what the current design made them think of.</p>

			<p>Surprisingly, a lot of the people I spoke with didn't mind the current design's themes.

			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>For this project, the majority of research was completed by Emily while I began rough sketching ideas and speaking with our client. The SWOT analysis, personas, and wordlist can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ellcorey/kindness_app/tree/master/research_ed">Github</a>.

	    	<h2>Design</h2>
	    	<p>For the design portion of this project, I worked out some early user flows before sketching some basic layout ideas. This all started earlier in the project than normal, and I knew that meant a higher chance of changes, and those changes could be more difficult. Given our short time line, I understood the risk &mdash; being flexible was key.</p>

	    	<h3>Style Tiles</h3>
	    	<p>Style tiles were created for this project to show our client variations of color, typographic choices, and share an overall feel. The argument for using style tiles is they give a better idea of the project direction than a mood board, and aren't as time consuming as mock-ups. for this project were split up amongst both designers. 5 tiles in total were submitted to our client for feedback, and ultimately one was selected and tweaked.</p>

	    		<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/goodreads/gr_styles02.jpg" alt="unused style tile">
	    	</div>

	    	<h3>Low fidelity sketches</h3>
	    	<p>Screen sketches were created using the research we had done and user flows. Once I had confirmed a sketch, I could hand it off to Emily to wireframe.</p>

	    	</div>

	    	<h3>High fidelity mock-ups</h3>
	    	<p>The mock-ups for all screens were created in Adobe Illustrator. After completing a sequence of wireframes, Emily would hand them off to me to create the mock-ups. Emily created a few of the mock-up screens as well, and afterwards, I would check them for continuity with my mock-ups.

	    	<h3>Invision prototyping</h3>
	    	<p>This was my first experience with prototyping an app in Invision. I took our mockup screens, imported them into Invision, and mapped out the flows between screens. Unlike applications such as Pixate, Framer, and Flinto, Invision currently only offers a few pre-set interactions. Choosing the correct prototyping tool for your project is very important.</p>

	    	<p>For our client, interactions were more important to broadly show flow through the app. Invision was perfect. Had we needed to prototype a complex interaction that would help provide context and reduce cognitive load, we would have looked to something else.
