        <title>Designing for Mobile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Designing for mobile is an ever changing and intriguing task. Always reevaluating how people use a product, adapting to an endless stream of new device technology. Some designers find themselves questioning not just what mobile will mean tomorrow, but what it means today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the environment a mobile device is likely used. For this post’s sake, let’s put wearables aside and discuss phones and tablets only. Mobile devices could be, and likely are, used in almost any environment. Often, with little to moderate attention as someone tries to achieve the task at hand quick. Luke Wroblewski in his book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp&quot;&gt;Mobile First&lt;/a&gt;, refers to this on the go, low attention use case as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“one eyball and one thumb.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I this this is an accurate description, and feel that if you think this way, your product will maintain its focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covering the external environment shows how important it is to maintain focus within your mobile product so a user can achieve the desired task. Now the device itself can be added to the equation. Devices have a multitude of display sizes, display resolutions, hardware abilities, physical button layouts, and various ways to connect to the internet. If you’re designing for mobile web, it is imperative to consider many, if not all, of these variables. Building a native app may allow you to narrow down some of these, dependent on the OS, but that’s another discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve narrowed down to a device with a diagonal screen size upwards of 13”, probably has a resolution between 72 and 300 dpi, may or may not have built in GPS/accelerometers/microphone/camera, is probably touch screen (but might have full physical keyboard), has a random number of physical buttons that do various things, and may or may not connect to cellular data networks. This is [hopefully] where your client or in house team has user data and research to narrow this down, because that is a lot to consider. It’s also a giant reason to fly the responsive web design flag if your product is for mobile web. But, what about software and different mobile web browsers? Yeah, different browsers handle your site differently and often device dependent. I’m willing to bet the majority of mobile web traffic is on the built in browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got an idea of where you’re headed, you can begin to work on the product. Again, mobile web arguably requires more consideration. With proper media queries in your CSS, your site or web app can function on target devices with incredible accuracy. Yeah, it may need updates (then further updates) as you begin to gather more device data from analytics. Thankfully, it’s not that difficult to establish a viable product that functions well on a variety of devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With layout and text, I’ve learned that it’s important to remember our distracted user. If you have content clutter and/or text that’s too small, how’s your content is difficult to use in a distracted environment. Some designers try to make up for smaller screens by  making shrinking content and cramming it into the viewport. That’s an incorrect approach and doing the opposite is better. I would rather scroll than strain. But really, this moment gives you the chance to focus on what is essential to your core feature[s] and drop the superfluous that may creep in. It also shows the importance of good content management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most devices these days being touch screen, layout is more important than ever. Touch targets that are small or close don’t offer much room for error and the thumb is not an instrument of accuracy. Try holding a baseball card (or similar item) with hand and tracing the players face with that same hand’s thumb. You could draw a smiley face if you’re dexterous. Now do it while walking. That’s the environment and the level of error you need to account for in your mobile design. The placement of touch targets is just as important. You don’t want to place destructive, and possibly frustrating buttons in high-error locations. Deleting data or closing a window due to an errant tap could cause your user base to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That covers the one thumb, but what about the one eyeball? Type sizing is obviously important, but so is the type face. Some fonts won’t scale down well and become blurred, or they generally become difficult to read on smaller screens. It’s important to test on various displays so your product doesn’t become unusable at certain screen sizes and resolutions. The text should also have strong contrast. Users may not know how to adjust the brightness on their device. What is legible in the dark could become illegible with the smallest amount of light. Also, a decent percentatge of the population is colorblind on some level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these things and more must be considered with mobile product design. It is just the tip of an ever growing iceberg, but rest assured that with proper leg work and data, it is achievable. Why not simply target the bullseye and leave a lot of users without? The market you leave unattended is the same market where a competitor can grow. Mobile products can become outdated just as quickly as the mobile devices they’re used on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this post may sound awfully familiar to anyone who’s read Luke Wroblewski’s “Mobile First” book. That’s solely out of my absolute respect for Mr. Wroblewski. If you haven’t yet, buy it and read it — it is worth every penny of it’s absurdly reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TIY UI Design - week 06</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-6&quot;&gt;Week 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing to look back over all we’ve learned and were able to accomplish by the end of week 05. Trial by fire some may call it, the Iron Yard’s Hackathon holds a spot in the student’s hearts. The standard week-in week-out of an immersive coding and design school is already compressed and forces you through a range of emotions while constantly out of your comfort zone. The Hackothon compresses that further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.5 days — from noon Thursday to 1am Monday - you work with your team to spring an idea, plan the process, and build a functioning app working with a database. And you do this with 5 or so weeks of experience! My team was awesome, working long and hard, and with great companionship — I couldn’t have asked for more. After the dust settled, my initial reaction is, “Wow, that was a hell of a lot of work, but equally as rewarding.” It could possibly be one of the highlights of my Iron Yard experience. Needless to say, a little bit of a break was in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll--markdown&quot;&gt;Jekyll &amp;amp; Markdown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you weren’t aware, this site is built off of Jekyll, a “blog-aware” framework designed to help build efficient blogs using the Markdown language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a nifty language that is easy and quick to type and can be converted to html. These blog posts are written in Markdown and allow me to effortlessly write posts without having to muck about with html tags and elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;gt; Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend reading that post as Daring Fireball’s author, John Gruber, is one of the creators. It will give you a thorough overview of the syntax and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;paper--prototyping&quot;&gt;Paper &amp;amp; prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve begun to study rapid prototyping techniques and how to effectively use them to help product design. A quick exercise involving teams of two was set up to paper prototype a user action on an airline website. The process myself and parter selected was choosing a flight with US Airways. While we found a small number of ways we believe the site could be improved, we learned a lesson that prototyping should make extensive use of data and a hypothesis which may require more time than we were allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a couple of quick tests, we were able to find that our hypothesis of removing additional choices in the flight filter options, and moving the price to a more prominent location, resonated with our test demographic (my classmates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the power of paper prototyping is real, but I am more excited to get into prototyping tools like InVision. Continuing with my goal of working on a native product, I want to become familiar with these tools and the experience of using them in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Iron Yard UI Design</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-2&quot;&gt;week 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 2 is behind me. In its wake are pieces of knowledge related to CSS preprocessors, placed hastily in the file cabinets of my brain. Our end-of-week project included engineering a grid via a SASS mixin and recreating a site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getpocket.com&quot;&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt; with 3 or more break points. Even though I was cramming SCSS down, I feel I’ve got a solid grasp of how it functions and using it’s features. This was not a straightforward or easy task, and the uneasiness of being outside of my comfort zone continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-3&quot;&gt;Week 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in week 3 now. I’ve begun what is my third and largest project of the UI course – a redesign of a local restaurant’s website. Our task is redesingning a local restaurant’s website. My subject is local French restaurant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cheznousaustin.com&quot;&gt;Chez Nous&lt;/a&gt; – a lovely little spot in downtown Austin. Their food is excellent, and the atmosphere is authentic European dining. Their site is not terrible, (certainly not when compared to many others) but it does not communicate the experience. Additionally, the UI sports bland navigation, poorl page layouts and flows, and unresponsive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many areas to improve upon and that’s what I’ve set out to do. It has started with design sketches showing a new interface for both small and large screens, and typeface discovery for use on the site and menu. We’ve been spending a decent amount of time on typography this week and this exercise is set to strengthen our use of typography in UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a typeface or font for your project is of the upmost importance. There is huge emphasis on type and how it can effect the user’s experience. Choose the correct typeface and you can communicate the weight of your content effortlessly, choose poorly and the content may be unreadable. I understand typography, but I want to master it and doing so requires experience. I’m looking forward to strengthening that experience and receiving critical feedback in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Iron Yard UI Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not a writer. Sometimes I like to think I am, but that’s hardly the case. These entries will serve as something of a record. Aside from my experiences at the Iron Yard, I’ll add content related to design and other aspects of my life (I’m also not a phillospher). I’m more than just a designer after all. Now that’s out of the way, let’s continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August.24 2015 was a big step on my path in the design field. I’ve worked in design before,  but I’ve yearned for something more than the graphic design I’d been doing. On that day, I started The Iron Yard’s User Interface Design immersive. I made sure to do my research on this non-standard school. The Iron Yard is well recognized for it’s graduates, and I had difficulty finding negative experiences - from students and hiring managers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-1&quot;&gt;week 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week one kicked off immediately with web development. Prior to The Iron Yard, I had minimal experience in web design. I had only used editors with WYSIWYG interfaces. Maybe I would add in a few lines of custom CSS after doing research and psyching myself up to realize a mistake could wreak havoc. Also, I had spent quite a few hours with Team Treehouse’ online learning courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured it would be a challenge, but it was harder than that. Hiking Pikes Peak quickly turned into an attempt to summit Everest. The shear amount that I learned about hand-coding a website was phenomenal. Every day it was new tags &amp;amp; attributes and properties &amp;amp; values. I felt I had a grip on it, and my code didn’t seem too bad. My first project was coming along, but it wasn’t there yet. I understood it needed to be responsive, and was ready for the next step. Media Queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media queries, it turns out, are lovely bits of CSS to help your site adapt to various screen sizes. They help to shape the site to best suit the viewport. I spent my first weekend coding several break points and learning how to adapt a site to different screen sizes. It is an eye opening experience and built into our course was a lesson of why “Mobile First” is more than just a talking point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the first week, I went to a  meetup where I was introduced to SASS, or more specifically SCSS. Our instructor, Abby, gave a rundown of setting up SASS and was followed by Una Kravets showing the capability of SASS. I left with a firm understanding that this tool would revolutionize the way I’ll code CSS in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;looking forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in the middle of week 2, and I’m working through SASS and grid systems. It’s a lot to onload so once my brain has cooled down I’ll get post two up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an uneasy feeling knowing that I’m just scratching the surface of web development. Understanding the concepts, technologies, and the people that work in those environments will be paramount to my success as a UI designer. We are just getting started, but one thing is clear — my education does not end in November. My appetite has returned and I plan to stay foolish and stay hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
